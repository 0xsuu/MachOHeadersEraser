MachOHeadersEraser
==================

A python program to remove some important information in MachO headers that most disassemblers use.



Useage: python eraser.py [Executable name]

This program needs #macholib#, find it on google. Thanks the authors for their work.



This program will generate a new executable and replace the raw one after making a backup.

And with testing, you can add some more removeable stuff to the lists. You can fork and add it. Also you can contact me if you have some idea about it.
